:: Project Scope ::

To create a soft distortion around text by replicating each letter with one of each color of the following: 

RED (rgb(255,0,0), 
GREEN (rgb(0,255,0)), and 
BLUE (rgb(0,0,255)) 

and one of each mix 

RED/GREEN (rgb(255,255,0), 
GREEN/BLUE (rgb(0,255,255), 
RED/BLUE (rgb(255,0,255)

.. and slightly offsetting it from the original text.
